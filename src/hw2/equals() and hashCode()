The equals() method checks if two objects are logically equal.

It must be:
-reflexive (an object is equal to itself);
-symmetric (if one object equals another, the second must equal the first);
-transitive (if one object equals a second and the second equals a third, the first must equal the third);
-consistent (the result should be the same for repeated comparisons);

must return false when compared to null.

The hashCode() method generates a numerical value (hash code) for an object. If two objects are equal according to the equals() method, they must have the same hash code.
However, two objects that are not equal can still have the same hash code (though itâ€™s unlikely).
